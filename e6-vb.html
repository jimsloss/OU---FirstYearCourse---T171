<center><b><u><font size=+2>Exercise 6: Analysing Vannevar Bush's vision</font></u></b></center>

<p>The train of thought which eventually led to the creation of the World
Wide Web was triggered by Vannevar Bush's article '<a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/unbound/flashbks/computer/bushf.htm">As
We May Think</a>', (if viewing this on-line then clicking on this hyperlink
will take you to the article, well worth the read) published in The Atlantic
Monthly of July 1945. The online edition of the magazine has republished
the article in its entirety on its web site. In this exercise, I want you
to download the article and create a succinct structured summary of it
in the form of a web page.
<p>When you have studied the article, you will find that it is divided
into numbered sections. Use this structure as the basis for your summary.&nbsp;
Create headings corresponding to each section, and add a few sentences
of text summarising the central point(s) Bush raises in that section. You
may do this either by writing your own summary, or by cutting and pasting
a few key sentences from the original. You can also add your own comments
- but marked in some distinguishing way (e.g. in a different colour, enclosed
in square brackets or in italics) - if you wish. Remember that the point
of the exercise is to capture the essence of Bush's paper in a short web
document.&nbsp; That means that you should try to distil the essence of
each section, not try to summarise everything in it. Often Bush wanders
off into digressions about, or discussions of, technologies which are now
long obsolete.&nbsp; This is not what we're interested in. What's important
is to get to the heart of his vision.
<p>Your structured summary should take this general form:
<p>Introduction
<p>Section 1
<p>Bush argues that physicists are the scientists who have been most changed
by their wartime experiences. [Comment: this first section seems a bit
confused - it's not clear what he's getting at, or what it has to do with
the rest of the paper.]
<p>Section 2
<p>Science [and technology?] is great but we are in danger of being swamped
by the increasing mountain of knowledge. 'Professionally our methods of
transmitting and reviewing the results of research are generations old
and by now are totally inadequate for their purpose'. Goes on to cite examples.
Ends by hinting that new technologies may have something to offer us in
this context.
<p>Section 3
<p>Etc.
<p>(The author then invited the reader to look at his attempt of the exercise,
<a href="e6-ans.htm">my
own attempt</a> was quite lengthy, even in summary form.)
