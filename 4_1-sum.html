<u>The history of the Net: A story in six episodes</u></font></b>
<p>As already indicated, the origins of the Internet go back quite a long
way.&nbsp; This module divides the story up into a number of 'episodes'.
<p><b>Prehistory:</b> Ideas which led to the Internet, or which inspired
the individuals who conceived and built the system. These mainly stem from
one institution - the Massachussetts Institute of Technology (MIT) - and
a group of extraordinary scientists and engineers who worked there.&nbsp;
These included: Vannevar Bush, Norbert Wiener, Claude Shannon and JCR Licklider.&nbsp;
In this module we focus on two - Bush and Licklider.
<p><b>ARPA and the ARPANET: </b>ARPA was a special agency within the US
Department of Defense set up to fund and foster advanced research in a
number of areas, including computing.&nbsp; In 1966 the Agency decided
to construct an experimental wide-area network which would link ARPA-funded
research laboratories across the United States.&nbsp; The ARPANET was designed
and built between 1967 and 1972.
<p><b>The Internet:</b> The ARPANET was a single, monolithic network. The
Internet as we know it today evolved from the ARPANET.&nbsp; The drive
behind the 'internetting' project (which was also funded by ARPA) was to
find a way of linking different networks together into a 'network of networks'.
This took from 1973 until about 1983.
<p><b>The World Wide Web:</b> The Web was invented in CERN, the international
high-energy physics laboratory in Geneva, in 1989.&nbsp; The technical
infrastructure for the Web was in existence by 1991, but it was not until
1993 with the launch of the first of the big 'browser' programs that the
web took off.
<p>In addition to these four main episodes, two other developments are
important if one is to understand the distinctive culture of the Internet.&nbsp;
These are:
<p><b>Usenet News:</b> This is basically the system of global online conferences
(usually called Newsgroups) in which much of the discussion that is held
on the Internet takes place.
<p><b>The Open Source Movement:</b> This is a social movement, comprised
mainly of expert programmers, who share a particular view regarding intellectual
property and who have evolved a distinctive way of developing software.
