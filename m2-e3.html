<p><b><u><font size=+2>Exercise 3: Reading</font></u></b></center>

<p><b>Different types of reading</b>
<p>In this exercise you will look at how you should approach reading a
difficult piece of text, and what you can do to get the most from it.
<p>Different people read at different speeds. The average is about 200
words per minute. However, the speed at which you read should vary according
to the material. If the text is reasonably hard and you want to follow
the arguments closely (the sort of text that forms most of this course)
then your reading time may drop to about 70 words per minute. If the text
is difficult and unfamiliar and you need to understand it in depth (such
as an article from an academic journal) your reading speed may go down
to about 40 words a minute. It is important to adjust your reading speed
accordingly, and not try and read everything at the same rate. Think of
it like driving speeds - there are indicators in text which tell you what
sort of speed you should be reading at, just as we have signs for driving
speeds. Some of these indicators will be in the type of language - if it
fairly informal and 'friendly' (like Cringely's book) then you can read
moderately quickly. If the language is academic and difficult, then this
is a sign that you need to read carefully and make sure you understand
the points. There will also be indicators given by the context of the text
- if it appears as an article in a Sunday magazine then you can probably
read it fairly quickly, since it was intended for that purpose. If it appears
in a world renowned journal, then the authors intend the audience to devote
considerable time and thought to it.
<p>Okay, so you know you can adjust your reading speed, but what else?
If your tutor gives you a difficult article to read and asks you to summarise
it for the next tutorial, then what should you do (apart from feign illness
at the next tutorial)? Well, like note taking your reading strategy will
be a personal matter, but here is some recommended good practice.
<p>First of all do a survey of the text. Your first temptation will be
to dive straight in and start reading ('Let's get this over with!'). Resist
this temptation. A few minutes spent skimming over the text will pay off.
What do I mean by skimming? When you skim read you are not reading in detail,
but merely reading to get a flavour of the material. Read at a high speed
(the national speed limit applies when skimming). Read the first paragraph,
as this will introduce the main topics and arguments. Then read the first
sentence only of each subsequent paragraph keeping a mental note of important
points, but don't stop to read these in detail. Read the last two or three
paragraphs at a slower speed. You may not understand these as yet, but
they should give you a feeling for what the material is trying to say.
If it is a report or book, then familiarise yourself with the contents
page or the abstract or the preface. This survey of the text will make
you comfortable with it, so when you read it in detail you do so in a familiar
context. After all you know how it ends - like reading a who-dunnit novel
after you've read the last page.
<p>The next step is to read in detail. This is not simply a matter of reading
the text however. You should also be engaged in a process of questioning
it. I mentioned in About Module 2 in the segment The Book - Accidental
Empires that a book or article usually has an underlying premise. Most
essays or articles follow the same pattern: an Introduction in which the
author outlines what they are going to say and their basic premise, the
main body in which they provide evidence to back this up, and a conclusion
in which they draw it all together and summarise their findings.
<p>When reading you should ask yourself 'What is the author trying to say?'.
This should be apparent from the first paragraph or so, and you should
keep it in mind as you read. Much of the following text will then provide
evidence for the author's underlying argument. You should ask 'How is this
relevant?' and whether the author has deliberately twisted some points
to fit their argument. When you get to the conclusion you should ask yourself
'Is this conclusion justified?' and 'Do I believe him/her?'.
<p>You should also look at the structure of the text, and how the author
uses this to make their point. I said that most essays follow an introduction,
main body and conclusion format, but this may vary and be manipulated by
the author. By examining the text in this way you will come to appreciate
it more.
<p>You should also be aware of the style of writing the author uses - are
they presenting hard facts, or expressing opinions? Are they using emotive
arguments? Are they presenting some things as facts which are in reality
just opinion, or distorted facts? Do they use wit to get their point across
(it is often harder to disagree with someone who makes you laugh)? Do you
agree with what the author has said? If not do you have a reasonable argument?
Another good question to ask yourself at the the end is 'Did I understand
all of that?'. If the answer is no, then it may pay to read it through
carefully again, after a 'cooling down' period. You will be surprised at
how often text makes sense on a second reading. If there was a particular
part you didn't understand then you may need to do some checking - this
may be looking up some terms in a dictionary or reading a recommended article
(perhaps one listed in the text you have read), or asking someone else
such as your tutor.
<p>After a careful reading (or two) of the text you should make some notes.
In your notes you should include the key points, and also try and answer
some of the questions posed above. The notes you are making on difficult
text may need to be more detailed than your ordinary notes. For instance,
it is a good idea to write down any major references the author uses, and
to add a detailed section about how you felt about the article. Here are
the sorts of question you should address in your notes, often explicitly
trying to answer them:
<ul>
<li>
What is the author trying to say?</li>

<li>
Do I believe them?</li>

<li>
What is the structure of the text?</li>

<li>
Does the evidence support the claims?</li>

<li>
Do I agree with the author?</li>
</ul>

<p><br><b>The Exercise</b>
<br>You are going to make similar notes for a specific piece of text, namely
Chapter 3 of Accidental Empires, (one of the set books for the course).
You should re-read Chapter 3 using the method described above.
<p>Your notes should pick out the main points of the text and also address
the questions listed above.
<p>(The author then directed the reader to his own notes on the above chapter,
as an example of what he was looking for.&nbsp; He then made several points
about them, to generalise on the reasons behind the notes he had taken.)
