<blockquote><font size=-1>>Introduction to Dr. Vannevar Bush as <i>the</i>
leading scientist and to this article summarising the paper with: The perfection
of these pacific instruments should be the first objective of our scientists
as they emerge from their war work. This paper calls for a new relationship
between thinking man and the sum of our knowledge.</font></blockquote>
<font size=-1>The paper provides ideas on how technology may be improved,
giving possible working examples and explainations of how current methods
can be improved or used with other existing methods to a better good. He
throws out all sorts of ideas which can now be seen in technology more
than 50yrs later. The paper was initially aimed at the people who have
the thought, ability and resources to make the changes happen, the ideas
he presents are all possible extensions of contemporary working methods.</font>

<p><b><font size=-1>1</font></b></center>

<p><font size=-1>[Asks and answers..] Of what lasting benefit has been
man's use of science and of the new instruments which his research brought
into existence?&nbsp; Science has provided the swiftest communication between
individuals; it has provided a record of ideas and has enabled man to manipulate
and to make extracts from that record so that knowledge evolves and endures
throughout the life of a race rather than that of an individual.</font>
<p><font size=-1>[Discusses difficulties in transmitting and reviewing
the results of the growing 'mountain of research', pointing out that contemporary
methods are outdated.&nbsp; Also notes that problem with having material
reach its intended audience]</font>
<p><font size=-1>The difficulty seems to be, not so much that we publish
unduly in view of the extent and variety of present day interests, but
rather that publication has been extended far beyond our present ability
to make real use of the record. The summation of human experience is being
expanded at a prodigious rate, and the means we use for threading through
the consequent maze to the momentarily important item is the same as was
used in the days of square-rigged ships.</font>
<p><font size=-1>Discusses available technology pointing out 'there are
plenty of mechanical aids with which to effect a transformation in scientific
records.'</font>
<p><font size=-1>Gives two examples, (Leibnitz inventing a calculating
machine 2 centuries before, and Babbage's invention of an arithmetical
machine) to demonstrate how technological advancement is also hindered
by current economic conditions, and how complexity and unreliability were
seen to be synonymous.&nbsp; Uses this as his foothold to sell advancement,
giving examples of how contemporary complex items where then being built
which were reliable and how the economy was supporting the construction
of such complex items.</font>
<p><font size=-1>End message "The world has arrived at an age of cheap
complex devices of great reliability; and something is bound to come of
it."</font>

<p><b><font size=-1>2</font></b></center>

<p><font size=-1>Discussion on methods of record storage, examines future
possibilities and fits these in with contemporary methods.&nbsp; Gives
some detail of the possible advancements of photography (including dry
photography)&nbsp; making comparisons with television at the time to give
possible scenarios of 'how' it could be done.&nbsp; Also discusses possibilities
of microphotography and improvments possible with microfilm. Expands this
by examining the possible compression of volume "A library of a million
volumes could be compressed into one end of a desk."</font>
<p><font size=-1>&lt;If the human race has produced since the invention
of movable type a total record, in the form of magazines, newspapers, books,
tracts, advertising blurbs, correspondence, having a volume corresponding
to a billion books, the whole affair, assembled and compressed, could be
lugged off in a moving van.>&nbsp; [could this be were Ted Nelson got his
idea for Xanadu?]</font>
<p><font size=-1>Mere compression, of course, is not enough; one needs
not only to make and store a record but also be able to consult it, and
this aspect of the matter comes later. Even the modern great library is
not generally consulted; it is nibbled at by a few.</font>
<p><font size=-1>Compression is important, however, when it comes to costs.
The material for the microfilm <i>Britannica</i> would cost a nickel, and
it could be mailed anywhere for a cent. What would it cost to print a million
copies?</font>
<center>
<p><b><font size=-1>3</font></b></center>

<p><font size=-1>Continuing with record storage he now moves to voice storage.&nbsp;
Discusses possibility of computers which type when talked to, providing
contemporary examples, (Voder at World Fair, Bell Laboratories' Vocoder
and the stenotype).</font>
<p><font size=-1>Discusses automatic input of data via cards with punched
holes, and complete automation of the system. Also notes that these would
prove invaluable to some businesses.</font>
<p><font size=-1>Makes point that future arithmetical machines will be
electrical in nature, will perform 100 times faster or more, and will be
far more versatile than present commercial machines, so that they may readily
be adapted for a wide variety of operations. They will be controlled by
a control card or film, they will select their own data and manipulate
it in accordance with the instructions thus inserted.&nbsp; Such machines
will have enormous appetites. One of them will take instructions and data
from a whole roomful of girls armed with simple key board punches, and
will deliver sheets of computed results every few minutes. There will always
be plenty of things to compute in the detailed affairs of millions of people
doing complicated things.</font>
<center>
<p><b><font size=-1>4</font></b></center>

<p><font size=-1>Discussion on the importance of computers dealing with
arithmetic functions and on how this should continue to proceed, taking
on more advanced mathematices for the scientist and other functions, giving
the scientist time to work on matters other than working out calculation.
Also briefs on relegating matters other than arithmetic and statistics
to the machine.</font>
<center>
<p><b><font size=-1>5</font></b></center>

<p><font size=-1>This paragraph discusses the aspect of logic thinking
by a computer, the need for building mechanisms for reassurance in advanced
logic functions.&nbsp; He discusses the need for symbolism, (machine talk?
ie operating system or computer language?) in order to reduce mathematical
transformations to machine processes.</font>
<p><font size=-1>Discusses computer selection needs and methods "Selection
devices will soon be speeded up from their present rate of reviewing data
at a few hundred a minute. By the use of photocells and microfilm they
will survey items at the rate of a thousand a second, and will print out
duplicates of those selected."&nbsp; Also selective selection, the telephone
exchange, instead of searching items in turn it starts with the first then
second number and so on.."the process could be speeded up if increased
speed were economically warranted. If necessary, it could be made extremely
fast by substituting thermionic-tube switching for mechanical switching,
so that the full selection could be made in one one-hundredth of a second.
No one would wish to spend the money necessary to make this change in the
telephone system, but the general idea is applicable elsewhere."</font>
<p><font size=-1>Talks about the cash register and possible updates, involving
rapid selection, dry photography and distant projection.</font>
<center>
<p><b><font size=-1>6</font></b></center>

<p><font size=-1>This is the most important chapter, here Bush discusses
several items which are now seen in everyday use.</font>
<p><font size=-1>Selection procedures: indexing, subclass to subclass.
It can be in only one place, cumbersome rules as to which path will locate
it. Having found one item, one has to emerge from the system and re-enter
on a new path.</font>
<p><font size=-1>Selection by association, rather than indexing, "The human
mind does not work that way. It operates by association. With one item
in its grasp, it snaps instantly to the next that is suggested by the association
of thoughts" [hyperlinks?]</font>
<p><font size=-1>"One cannot hope thus to equal the speed and flexibility
with which the mind follows an associative trail," <font color="#FF6666">[I
disagree, either this may be matched/overtaken/improved at some future
point or we might see our thoughts controlling what we see on screen, possible
not even a screen but some three-dimensional interactive image]</font></font>
<p><font size=-1>Discussion of the "memex".. a sort of mechanized private
file and library. A device in which an individual stores all his books,
records, and communications, and which is mechanized so that it may be
consulted with exceeding speed and flexibility. It is an enlarged intimate
<b><i>supplement
to his memory. </i></b><font color="#FF6666">[possibly ment as storage
of experienced things, things you know on record rather than I lot of things
you don't know but are yet to read]</font></font>
<p><font size=-1>It consists of a desk, and while it can presumably be
operated from a distance, it is primarily the piece of furniture at which
he works. [personal workstation - desktop?] On the top are slanting translucent
screens, on which material can be projected for convenient reading. [Monitor]
There is a keyboard, and sets of buttons and levers. Otherwise it looks
like an ordinary desk.&nbsp; In one end is the stored material. The matter
of bulk is well taken care of by improved microfilm. [computer memory]
Only a small part of the interior of the memex is devoted to storage, the
rest to mechanism.</font>
<p><font size=-1>Most of the memex contents are purchased on microfilm
ready for insertion. Books of all sorts, pictures, current periodicals,
newspapers, are thus obtained and dropped into place. Business correspondence
takes the same path. And there is provision for direct entry. On the top
of the memex is a transparent platen. On this are placed longhand notes,
photographs, memoranda, all sorts of things. When one is in place, the
depression of a lever causes it to be photographed onto the next blank
space in a section of the memex film, dry photography being employed.</font>
<p><font size=-1>There is, of course, provision for consultation of the
record by the usual scheme of indexing. If the user wishes to consult a
certain book, he taps its code on the keyboard, and the title page of the
book promptly appears before him, projected onto one of his viewing positions.
Frequently-used codes are mnemonic, so that he seldom consults his code
book; but when he does, a single tap of a key projects it for his use.&nbsp;
[Function keys] Moreover, he has supplemental levers. On deflecting one
of these levers to the right he runs through the book before him, each
page in turn being projected at a speed which just allows a recognizing
glance at each. If he deflects it further to the right, he steps through
the book 10 pages at a time; [as on word processor] still further at 100
pages at a time. Deflection to the left gives him the same control backwards.</font>
<p><font size=-1>A special button transfers him immediately to the first
page of the index. [Home key] Any given book of his library can thus be
called up and consulted with far greater facility than if it were taken
from a shelf. As he has several projection positions, he can leave one
item in position while he calls up another. [Windows] He can add marginal
notes and comments, taking advantage of one possible type of dry photography,
and it could even be arranged so that he can do this by a stylus scheme,
such as is now employed in the telautograph seen in railroad waiting rooms,
just as though he had the physical page before him.</font>
<center>
<p><b><font size=-1>7</font></b></center>

<p><font size=-1>Details of the associative indexing, whereby any item
may be caused at will to select immediately and automatically another.
This is the essential feature of the memex. The process of tying two items
together is the important thing.</font>
<p><font size=-1>When the user is building a trail, he names it, inserts
the name in his code book, and taps it out on his keyboard. Before him
are the two items to be joined, projected onto adjacent viewing positions.
At the bottom of each there are a number of blank code spaces, and a pointer
is set to indicate one of these on each item. The user taps a single key,
and the items are permanently joined. In each code space appears the code
word. Out of view, but also in the code space, is inserted a set of dots
for photocell viewing; and on each item these dots by their positions designate
the index number of the other item. [hypertext working]</font>
<p><font size=-1>Thereafter, at any time, when one of these items is in
view, the other can be instantly recalled merely by tapping a button below
the corresponding code space. Moreover, when numerous items have been thus
joined together to form a trail, they can be reviewed in turn, rapidly
or slowly, by deflecting a lever like that used for turning the pages of
a book. It is exactly as though the physical items had been gathered together
from widely separated sources and bound together to form a new book. It
is more than this, for any item can be joined into numerous trails. [there
is mention in the course material that this refers to what is now the internet.&nbsp;
looking at this from Bush's perspective I see this as a way of using the
memex to view the self-contained messages for the single user.&nbsp; However
the anologies with the internet are astounding considering this was written
in 1945, long before the pc.&nbsp; The amount of memory, the threads, the
linking of documents, widely separated sources bound together. The important
difference here, which is yet to be established, is that all the documents
the user needs are held on the computers memory itself.]</font>
<p><font size=-1>Interesting example of how someone would use the memex
in order to obtain information on a given subject, view and link documents
to form a trail and inputting his own comments as part of the trail.&nbsp;
There is also mention here of copying the trail in order that it may be
passed on to someone else to use in their memex.</font>

<p><font size=-1>This section looks at the availability and usages of readymade
trails, within the available exterior microfilm sources.</font>
<p><font size=-1>Points out that his views here are based on sticking closely
to methods and elements already known and improving, rather than basing
his prophecies on the unknown.</font>
<p><font size=-1>Discusses current uses of mechanical items which convey
information from the senses, such as the tv operating like the eye, the
hearing aid, the typist and the encephalograph (reads brain activity).
explains the processes used in these methods and asks " Is it not possible
that some day the path may be established more directly?" [ie that the
brain signals themselves might induce the control or activity, rather than
the transforation of electrical signals to mechanical and back to electrical
again.]</font>
