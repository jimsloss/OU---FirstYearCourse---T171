<p><b><u><font size=+2>Section 6.3: The original proposal and its realisation</font></u></b></center>

<p>What CERN needed, Berners-Lee argued, was some kind of linked information
system.
<p>But what sort of system? After criticising the types of linking which
were then in vogue - for eg, the hierarchical tree-structures exemplified
by the 'help' systems of minicomputers; or those which relied upon indexed
keywords - He proposed a solution to CERN's problem, it was called hypertext.
<p>The special requirements of a hypertext system for CERN were, he believed,
that it should:
<ul>
<li>
allow remote access across networks</li>

<li>
be heterogeneous (allow access to the same info from different types of
computer system)</li>

<li>
be non-centralised</li>

<li>
allow access to existing data</li>

<li>
enable users to add their own private links to and from public information,
and to annotate links as well as nodes privately, and</li>

<li>
enable 'live' links to be made between dynamically changing data.</li>
</ul>
Finally, he proposed 3 specific applications within CERN for such a system:
development project documentation; document retrieval; and personal skills
inventories (due to the large population of differently-skilled experts).
<p>The paper concludes with a recommendation that CERN should 'work toward
a universal linked information system in which generality and portability
are more important than fancy graphics techniques and complex extra facilities'.
<p><font color="#009900"><font size=-1>"The aim should be to allow a place
to be found for any information or reference which one felt was important,
and a way of finding it afterwards. The result should be sufficiently attractive
to use that the information contained would grow past a critical threshold,
so that the usefulness of the scheme would in turn encourage its increased
use. The passing of this threshold [should be] accelerated by allowing
large existing databases to be linked together and with new ones."</font></font>
<p>To test these ideas he proposed a practical project to build a prototype
system.&nbsp; 'I imagine', he wrote, 'that two people for 6 to 12 months
would be sufficient for this phase of the project'.&nbsp; A 2nd phase would
involve some programming in order to set up a real system at CERN on many
machines. An important part of this is the integration of a hypertext system
with existing data, so as to provide a universal system, and to achieve
critical usefulness at an early stage.
<p><b>The invention of the Web</b>
<br>Berners-Lee's proposal was first circulated in March 1989 with a rfc,
and re-circulated in May 1990. In October 1990 the project proposal was
reformulated with encouragement from CERN senior management and Robert
Cailliau as co-author. It was at this point that the central difference
between Berners-Lee's ideas and those of Engelbart, Nelson and Atkinson
became clear, for the name 'World-Wide Web' was chosen, implying that the
Net was an integral part of the concept from the word go. (The term 'web'
was not original, already being long established in the hypertext community).
<p>Thereafter, things moved with astonishing speed. In Nov 1990, Berners-Lee
and Cailliau&nbsp; wrote a program called a browser, which provided a virtual
'window' through which the user saw the 'web' of linked resources on the
Internet. It refracted a world of disparate info sources in such a way
that they appeared as a uniform whole. They also wrote a server program
which could deliver files on demand.
<p>Since the NeXT machine on which these initial programs were written
was pretty exotic hardware and their proposal had set as one of the design
criteria that the Web should work over a range of different computer systems,
there was clearly a need for another kind of browser which would function
on non-graphical displays. Accordingly a newly-arrived technical student
from Leicester Polytechnic called Nicola Pellow was set to work writing
a simple ' line-mode' browser.
<p>By Christmas 1990 demo versions of both browsers and a prototype web
server were available, enabling users to access hypertext files, articles
from Internet newsgroups and files from the help system of one of the CERN
computers.
<p>By March 1991, the line-mode browser was released to a limited audience
to run on the more powerful workstations in the CERN environment.
<p>On May 17 1991 the WWW software was generally released on central CERN
machines.
<p>In Aug 1991, info about the project and the software was posted in relevant
Internet newsgroups like
<ul>
<li>
alt.hypertext</li>

<li>
comp.sys.next</li>

<li>
comp.text.sgml</li>

<li>
comp.mail.multi-media.</li>
</ul>
In October 1991 gateways were installed enabling the browsers to access
Help files on the laboratory's Digital VAX computers and the Wide Area
Information Servers (WAIS) which were then the nearest thing to search
engines that the Internet possessed.
<p>Finally in Dec 1991, the CERN computer newsletter announced the Web
to the world of High Energy Physics. It had taken just over a year from
the moment Berners-Lee had typed the first line of code.
<p><b>The underlying model of the Web</b>
<br>The underlying model of the Web envisaged by Berners-Lee and Cailliau
was a 'client-server' one. They envisaged&nbsp;&nbsp; a system in which
information would be held on networked computers called servers, and that
these would be accessed by client programs (browsers) running on other
networked computers. Servers, in this model, are essentially givers, while
clients are always takers (though they give some information about themselves
to servers at the moment of interaction). The central tasks in building
such a system were to write the programs which would enable computers to
act as servers and clients, to create a common language in which both could
converse and to set up some conventions by which they could locate one
another.
<p>The client-server model was already well established, there were innumerable
machines on the Net which operated as servers, and there were several ways
of extracting information from them. At the lowest level, you could use
the primitive TELNET facility to log on to a remote machine and (with permission)
run programs on it. Or you could use the File Transfer Protocol (FTP) program
to log on remotely and download files. And there were various search facilities
- the precursors of search engines - for locating information on the Internet.
<p>In order to make use of these facilities, however, you needed to know
what you were doing. Accessing the Net before the Web was akin to using
MS-DOS or UNIX - you could do almost anything provided you knew the lingo.
The trouble was that the lingo was user-hostile. Computer experts took
to it like ducks to water; the rest of humanity, however, looked the other
way.
<p>The pre-WWW Net was, wrote Robert Reid,
<p><font color="#009900"><font size=-1>'...an almost militantly egalitarian
and cooperative community. Nobody owned the network. Virtually nobody made
money from it directly. Almost every piece of software that governed or
accessed it was free. But the Internet's tight de facto admission requirements
of technical acumen, access and pricey tools also made it a very elite
realm.'</font></font>
<p>One of the central tasks Berners-Lee faced was the lowering of this
threshold. He achieved it partly by inventing an interface - a program
which stood between the user and the vast and disparate info resources
of the Net. In seeking a model for this interface he drew heavily on ideas
which had emanated from the hypertext community, where the problem of navigating
through a virtual space of linked texts had been addressed through the
notion of a 'browser', i.e. a virtual window which displayed the structure
of the space. The Xerox NoteCards system developed in the early 1980s,
for eg, had a special 'browser card' which displayed editable node-link
diagrams showing the structure of some portion of the hypertext network
currently in use. Other hypertext or hypermedia systems had similar tools.
<p>But to the original hypertext notion of browsing, the CERN people added
something else which echoed the thinking of Ted Nelson, namely the idea
that documents should be editable by their readers. Berners-Lee's idea
of a browser therefore was not just an interface that would provide passive
<br>viewing, but something that would allow users to create their own inline
links even as they were reading a document. This is the one part of his
vision which did not survive beyond the CERN version (though it lives on
to some extent in the web-editing program(s) which you are using on this
course).
<p>Because Next workstations (and graphics terminals) were then still a
rarity in the networked computing world, it was essential that a non-graphical
browser also be developed. This is what Nicola Pellow had been charged
with creating - a program which would run on character-based screens, presenting
web resources as a set of items in a menu. Such a program had several advantages,
not least its relatively compact code size (which made it easy to run and
download) and the fact that it made few demands on the machines which would
run it.
<p><b>Release of the CERN WWW software</b>
<br>The Web went public on 15 January 1991 when the line-mode browser developed
at CERN was made available by the process known as 'anonymous FTP'. That
is to say, anyone with a Net connection and a copy of the FTP program could
call up the CERN site, log in without having to use a password and download
the browser code. Other researchers - many not based at CERN - were already
busy developing graphics-based browsers which did not require fancy workstations.
In April a Finnish browser for UNIX called 'Erwise' was released and this
was followed in May by the release of Pei Wei's Viola graphical browser
(also for UNIX machines). By July, CERN was distributing all the code (server
and browsers, including Viola) from its servers.
<p>In November 1992 there were 26 known WWW servers in existence, including
one at the US National Centre for Supercomputer Applications (NCSA) at
the University of Illinois at Champaign-Urbana. Two months later, the number
of servers had almost doubled - to 50. By Internet standards this was encouraging
growth, but nothing spectacular: the Web was still just one of the many
applications running across the network. Compared to E-mail, FTP and all
the other stuff running across the Net, the Web traffic was still pretty
small beer. This was dramatically changed in the Spring of 93 when a student
in Illinois launched a browser called Mosaic, which turned the Web into
a mass medium.
