<h2>
Exercise from Module 3</h2>
I have choosen <a href="e2-sum.html">Exercise 2</a>: 'Understanding search
engines', because this helped in overcoming the daunting part of searching
the net, making it more of a rewarding experience.
<p><b>The objectives of the Exercise;</b>
<ul>
<li>
To understand the different types of search engine</li>

<li>
Enable comparisons between them</li>

<li>
Develop an appreciation of how they work.</li>

<li>
Enhance search methods used and obtain better results.</li>

<li>
To understand copyright restrictions.</li>
</ul>
<b>What I have learnt;</b>
<p>It is imperative to get quick and relevant results when working on-line,
not only because of the time element but also the cost involved.&nbsp;
I now have a better understanding of the different search methods available,
(such as search directory, search engine and metasearching), of how the
'engines' perform their searches and feedback results, and of the different
ways in reducing the number of hits obtained.&nbsp; I can now employ enhanced
search criteria, choosing alternative search engines depending on the material
required, to obtain better and more relevant results.
<p><b>How I hope to develop this skill;</b>
<p>I felt this a strong subject and wanted to develop it more, so I choose
it as my 4th assignment. From this I have learnt a lot more of the history
of search methods (including WAIS, gophers, ftp, telnet and early search
engines). I have gained a few links to relative sites providing a comprehensive
list of contemporary search engines and intend to explore the differences
between them when time allows, hoping this helps with future courses.
