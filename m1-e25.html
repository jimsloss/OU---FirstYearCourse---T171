<p><b><u><font size=+2>Exercise 25: A first web page</font></u></b></center>

<p>This was the first step in learning how to prepare HTML documents, taking
an existing page, modifying it a little bit and then put it on the web.&nbsp;
By doing this we learnt to use the basic tools needed to create more complex
HTML documents.
<p>For simplicity, I used WordPad, as suggested by the tutor, (found from
Start - Programs - Accessories - then WordPad).
<p>For help it was suggested to go to the T171 Web HTML conference.
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b><u>Making changes to an HTML file</u></b>
<p>We began by looking at a document template in the browser.
<p>The first step was to look at the HTML that described the template.&nbsp;
To do this, with the template open in the browser, I selected View source,
in my browser.
<p>I noticed some HTML tags, of the form '&lt;sometext>', mixed in with
the content of the page, it was fairly easy to distinguish the text from
the tags.
<p>The copy of the template I was viewing was stored in Milton Keynes on
an Open University Web server.&nbsp; I could view its HTML source through
the browser, but I could not make changes to it.
<p>To enable me to make changes, I had to save a copy of the template onto
my hard disk, giving my copy the filename "templ1.htm".&nbsp; (The suffixes
'.htm' or '.html' are normally used for HTML files.)&nbsp; To do this,
having the template open in my browser I selected Save as from the File
menu, and typed in the name "templ1.htm", noting where it was saved.
<p>In my browser I then opened the file, (as opposed to opening a web location),
via File - Open, which gave a file dialogue box.&nbsp; Now I was looking
at my own local copy of the file, which I was then going to change, rather
than at the one on the OU Web server, which I couldn’t change.
<p>I then opened WordPad.&nbsp; In it I opened the copy of Template 1 I
had just saved on my hard disk, ensuring that I changed the drop-down File-type
box to ‘all files’.
<p>I was able to see the same HTML source as I had seen in my browser.
<p>I then made some minor changes, typing my name and my tutor's name where
indicated, before saving the file again, making sure that the Save As Type
box said Text document.&nbsp; (If you receive a warning that doing this
will lose all formatting, don't worry.)
<p>Keeping WordPad open, I switched back to my browser, and to see the
changes I had just made, selected 'refresh'.
<p>My browser now displayed Template 1 with my name and my tutor's name
inserted.&nbsp; (It’s a good idea to keep checking your browser to ensure
things are working out as expected.
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b><u>Publishing the file on the web</u></b>
<p>The final step in this exercise was to publish the page I had just changed
on the Web.
<br>You can do this in two ways:
<p>Through your ISP, if your contract includes web space.
<br>Through FirstClass
<p>I used FirstClass (as was recommended) to publish my page on the web.&nbsp;
To do this I had to access the OU server through the FC client instead
of through your browser.
<p>If your ISP provided you with web space, you could use that, they should
also have provided instructions on how to put pages onto their web servers,
and on-line or telephone help.&nbsp; Be sure you know the URL of the page
after you have put it up.
<p>Using the Home Page area in FirstClass I had to do the following:
<p>Connect to the OU server through the FC client, choose File - Open -
Home Page.
<p>A Home Page Folder icon appeared on my Desktop, you can only have one.&nbsp;
You can rename or delete it, but you should not move it off the Desktop,
it must stay on to work properly.
<p>I opened the Home Page Folder, and uploaded the file I had been working
on, via File - Upload - and then selecting the file in the dialogue box
which appeared.
<p>I then disconnected from the FC server.
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Finally, I had to check that it was live on the web using my browser.
<br>&nbsp;
<p>I opened my browser and viewed the file I had just uploaded, being on
the OU FirstClass server, the URL was:
<p><a href="temp1.htm">http://oufcnt5.open.ac.uk/~jim_sloss/temp1.htm</a>
