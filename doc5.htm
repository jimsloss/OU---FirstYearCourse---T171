TMA reflection</h2>
The second assignment (<a href="#Assignment 2">TMA02</a>), was to create
an individual web page and reflect on Module 1. It was linked to <a href="#Activity 3">Activity
3</a> which was to create a web channel as a group, which linked to the
individual pages created, I had taken on the core role of hosting this
web channel. This was the first time that I had attempted to create a full
web page or worked within a group in this manner and I learnt a lot from
it, for this reason I have choosen to reflect on this module.
<p>The assignment helped bring together aspects taught in Module 1, consolidating
learning with practical work.&nbsp; To complete the assignment required
revising the main objectives of Module 1 and putting these into practice.&nbsp;
The first part of the assignment dealing with creating a web page, researching
on-line (keeping in mind 'clear-thinking' and copyright aspects), and physical
group-working.&nbsp; The second part dealing with the applications (word-processing,
spreadsheets etc) used in Module 1, the <a href="#The learning to learn">'learning
to learn'</a> principle, and group working reflection.&nbsp; I also used
the Zip method of compressing files for the first time.
<p>On receiving <a href="#feedback">feedback</a> on my assignment I found
that I had not fully understood 'relative and absolute linking', as some
aspects of the web page weren't viewable offline. I worked with the assignment
after this and checked working links when disconnected from then Internet,
correcting the error.&nbsp; Since this I now check all links, ensuring
that they are proper.

<p><font color="#009900"><font size=-1>(ii) Explain the key principles
or techniques you have found which help in learning about computers. This
should demonstrate your 'learning to learn' skills. It should explain how,
other than being shown specific commands and key-presses, you can increase
your computing abilities.</font></font>

<br><font color="#009900"><font size=-1>Computers can be difficult and
temperamental at the best of times but when you are new to computers&nbsp;
the difficulty is increased tenfold.&nbsp; There are so many different
computers and computer applications on the market that learning to use
them can prove quite a challenge, but there are steps you can take to minimise
your efforts and maximise your ability.</font></font>
<p><font color="#009900"><font size=-1>I would consider myself to be familiar
with computers, but the course I am undertaking has taught me&nbsp; something
that I had taken for granted and not realised the importance of.&nbsp;
When you are new to a computer or application the best thing to do is to
explore it.&nbsp; Explore the menus, the functions, the help screens, the
filing system, the desktop, and don’t be afraid to try things out, you
cannot damage your computer in this way.&nbsp; Learn from mistakes you
make, look for workarounds, there’s always more than one way to do something,
and in most cases keyboard shortcuts can be more effective than the standard
method.</font></font>
<p><font color="#009900"><font size=-1>Not only does this method prove
most effective, but it is also an extremely fast way of rewarding yourself
for your efforts and gaining quick results.&nbsp; The more you explore
the more familiar you get with the way it works, and the more you get out
of it.</font></font>

<p><font size=-1>"The linked graphics in your page are still pointing to
the original (remote)location. This means that, when I load your TMA offline
(remember, I am not supposed to mark assignments when connected to the
Internet), they show up as broken icons. You should have supplied the graphics
together with the HTML files. Your code should have been amended to reflect
this. For example, the Bulger picture is referenced directly thus: &lt;img
src="http://www.cinemax.co.uk/1img1.gif">. You should have downloaded the
picture and linked it locally. Please get back to me on this if you are
unclear, as this is a very important issue."</font>
