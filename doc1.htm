<h2>
Conferencing and Netiquette</h2>
I have included below the text of 3 messages, taken from the group conference
on Activity 2 .&nbsp; The aim of this being to demonstrate some of the
principles (highlighted following the messages) picked up from studying
the article <a href="http://sustainability.open.ac.uk/gary/netiquette.html">'Netiquette,
or the social conventions of computer conferencing'</a>, of which I also
completed a <a href="review.html">Review</a>.
<p>Please see <a href="act2-sum.html">Activity 2, 'Effective groupwork'</a>
before continuing.
<br>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br><b>1. My initial message posted to the conference</b>
<p><font color="#009900"><font size=-1>Hi all, my apologies for being so
late with this, but having now read the 6 articles and reviewed the replies,
I would like to put my idea forward to the group;</font></font>
<p><font color="#009900"><font size=-1>The second stage of group development
is apparently 'storming', I have found the following quotes relating to
this..</font></font>
<br><font color="#009900"><font size=-1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
"The groups who dare to face the storming stage most honestly are the ones
who end up performing the best"</font></font>
<br><font color="#009900"><font size=-1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and..</font></font>
<br><font color="#009900"><font size=-1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
"Conflict, far from being a bad thing, is a main force for Creative development"</font></font>
<p><font color="#009900"><font size=-1>My interpretation of these would
be this, if we are prepared for the storm we can ride with it, using any
future&nbsp; 'flaming' or disagreements to 'enhance' our group performance,
rather than hinder it.</font></font>
<p><font color="#009900"><font size=-1>There are a lot of points that can
be noted to help the group explore this, some of these already raised in
the earlier replies, but my intention here is simply to raise the notion
for further discussion</font></font>
<p><font color="#009900"><font size=-1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
...Jim</font></font>

<br><b>2. The Course Tutor's response on completion of the Activity by
the group</b>
<p><font color="#009900"><font size=-1>OK folks.</font></font>
<p><font color="#009900"><font size=-1>This is the summary of what you
have been discussing. I have created a short list with the most salient
points that, according to you, we should take into consideration when doing
online conferencing.</font></font>
<p><font color="#009900"><font size=-1>1) Come to a shared understanding
or consensus;</font></font>
<br><font color="#009900"><font size=-1>2) Be open to each other's arguments;</font></font>
<br><font color="#009900"><font size=-1>3) Keep messages short;</font></font>
<br><font color="#009900"><font size=-1>4) Use (but not overuse!) emoticons
to convey emotions and prevent misunderstandings;</font></font>
<br><font color="#009900"><font size=-1>5) Be supportive to others and
do not let them feel intimidated;</font></font>
<br><font color="#009900"><font size=-1>6) Give plenty of constructive
feedback, whether positive or negative, otherwise it is difficult to negotiate
agreements;</font></font>
<br><font color="#009900"><font size=-1>7) Make good use of quoting previous
messages, so as to retain the context of what has gone before;</font></font>
<br><font color="#009900"><font size=-1>8) Use the system of majority vote
when disagreements occur that cannot be resolved in any other way;</font></font>
<br><font color="#009900"><font size=-1>9) Post your message to the appropriate
forum;</font></font>
<br><font color="#009900"><font size=-1>10) Avoid capital letters at any
cost, because they give the impression of "shouting";</font></font>
<br><font color="#009900"><font size=-1>11) Take the time to understand
the meaning of a message before replying to it;</font></font>
<br><font color="#009900"><font size=-1>12) Use conflict in a group as
a productive tool;</font></font>
<br><font color="#009900"><font size=-1>13) Do not sacrifice your view,
in order to reach a consensus. All sides (however isolated they might be)
must be taken into consideration, before a balanced agreement can be reached.</font></font>
<p><font color="#009900"><font size=-1>So, anybody wants to comment on
this?</font></font>
<p><font color="#009900"><font size=-1>Paolo</font></font>
<p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br><b>3. My reply to the summary</b>
<p><font color="#009900"><font size=-1>Paolo G. Cordone writes:</font></font>
<br><font color="#009900"><font size=-1>>OK folks.</font></font>
<br><font color="#009900"><font size=-1>></font></font>
<br><font color="#009900"><font size=-1>>summary of what you have been
discussing...</font></font>
<p><font color="#009900"><font size=-1>reply to above..</font></font>
<br><font color="#009900"><font size=-1>What about the time limits for
posting replies and views during group activities?&nbsp; If some replies
have not been received, ie some members have not put their points to the
group, then do we simply move on with the activity?</font></font>
<p><font color="#009900"><font size=-1>I would suggest that we all come
to an agreement on this before things go further, agree that, even if we
don't wish to comment, a reply should be posted stating this, and a given
deadline agreed for views to be considered..</font></font>
<p><font color="#009900"><font size=-1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
..just a thought...Jim</font></font>

<center>
<p><b><u><font size=+1>The Netiquette principles that can be pointed out
from this text are as follows:</font></u></b></center>

<p><br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<p>1. The messages were sent directly to the conference, not being addressed
to any one person
<p>2. My initial message was opened with an introduction and apologies,
starting the message in a good manner.
<p>3. All three messages have a good introduction, but in the third message
I have taken a point from the tutors summary, and used part of his message
to introduce my response, a brief line being sufficient.
<p>4. The quotes indicated in message 1 have quotation marks, but unfortunately
I neglected to ’acknowledge’ the author.
<p>5. Each message has presented their 'interpretation’ and invited further
discussion.
<p>6. There is an absence of emoticons at this stage, but although emoticons
can be useful in conveying tone or manner, I feel they are unsuitable to
unfamiliar recipients.&nbsp; They are best used when corresponding with
users who are familiar with the use of emoticons and whom you are aware
will not take offence or mis-understand the use of 'silly little faces'.
Using emoticons when corresponding with an unfamiliar recipient might seem
patronising.
