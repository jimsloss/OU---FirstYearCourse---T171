<center><b><u><font size=+2>2.4 moores law</font></u></b></center>

<p>As the technology of microprocessor design and manufacture advances
more and more transistors can be placed on each silicon chip.&nbsp; This
is summed up by Moore's Law, which states that the number of transistors
that can be placed on the same area of a microprocessor doubles every 18
months.&nbsp; Effectively this means that the power of one microprocessor
chip at one price doubles in 18 months.&nbsp; This is why the price of
computers stays about constant, but their power increases.&nbsp; It is
worth considering the implications of this law.&nbsp; It leads to an incredibly
fast-paced industry in which any company that lapses in development is
quickly left behind.&nbsp; Moore's Law has two main implications:
<p><b>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </b>The first is that computers will get increasingly
powerful. This means that the sort of computer available to most people
in the home or office in the future will be capable of more and more sophisticated
tasks.
<p><b>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </b>The second major implication is that microprocessors
become cheaper. Thus a microprocessor with a limited capability compared
to whatever is currently used in new computers will be available very cheaply,
perhaps for a few pence. These microprocessors can be placed in many products
with pre-programmed functions. This is why increasing numbers of appliances
have 'intelligence' advertised as a feature. Cheap, but powerful microprocessors
are often found in appliances like washing machines, video cassette recorders
and televisions.
<p>Moore’s law has proven very consistent so far, but there is a theoretical
maximum number of transistors which a piece of silicon can support in terms
of physical space and heat output.&nbsp; However, many experts have suggested
that by the time this maximum is reached there will be new technology available
which will allow Moore's Law to continue.
<p><b>Implications of Moore's Law</b>
<p>Allied with Moore's Law is the trend in storage capacity, which falls
in price on average by about 20% per year.&nbsp; This means that if I buy
a 5 gigabyte hard disk today, in a year's time I will be able to buy a
6 gigabyte one for about the same price.
<p>These two trends are set to continue, and they combine to provide both
cheap storage and effective processing of information.
<p>If you compare an information task performed by computing-intensive
methods with the same task performed by traditional people-intensive methods
(for eg finding all references to the word computer' in books published
this month), you would in most cases find that the time, effort and cost
savings would prove substantial if you used the computer.&nbsp; Although
the task is likely to take some time, it will be considerably quicker and
more reliable than doing this by hand.&nbsp; But of course this may depend
on the task, if it was something which required human expertise, the comparison
would have favoured the traditional method.
<p>This demonstrates that society as a whole can now use information in
a different way than was previously manageable.&nbsp; Tasks which would
have required too much effort, now become achievable in minutes.&nbsp;
This is why computers are important, and why the term 'information technology'
is often used to refer to computing and the manipulation, transfer and
storage of data.
<p>With these trends set to continue what are the implications for society?&nbsp;
Here are a few which you might like to consider.
<p><b>Computers everywhere</b>
<p>Cheap microprocessors are installed in many devices other than computers.&nbsp;
These microprocessors have pre-programmed capabilities and act as control
devices, so they are often called microcontrollers. It is almost impossible
to estimate the number of microprocessors and microcontrollers in existence.
Some estimates put it at more than 10 billion.&nbsp; This staggering number
is accounted for in all the different devices which now house micro controllers,
devices such as telephones, refrigerators, cash machines, toasters, washing
machines, photocopiers, watches, televisions, smart cards, radios, cars
and VCRs.
<p>Each of these devices may have many different microcontrollers (a car
may have over a hundred).&nbsp; So we already live in a world surrounded
by microprocessors, even if we are unaware of it.
<p>This trend shows no signs of slowing down as microprocessors become
cheaper to produce, and companies become more aware of the possibilities
they offer.&nbsp; One can imagine intelligent features in all manner of
products.&nbsp; For instance, food products which tell you when they have
expired, cars which diagnose their own faults, video recorders which search
for television programmes they think you will want to see.&nbsp; Or you
might envisage a central computer in your house which controls the heating,
the washing, checks stocks in the cupboards and orders the shopping, cooks
dinner for your arrival home, and so on.&nbsp; All of these are possible
with today's technology.
<p>This may sound exciting or terrifying to you, but it is important to
realise that there will be social implications of this sudden availability
of cheap computational power.
<p><b>They know everything about you</b>
<p>The amount of information available is almost limitless.&nbsp; This
means that a lot of information can be held about each person - what they
buy when they shop, what they watch on television, where they are, what
their credit rating is, and so on.&nbsp; Increasingly companies sell this
type of information to interested parties, such as manufacturers, advertisers
and mortgage brokers.&nbsp; This may be beneficial, for example if I am
employing an accountant it would be useful to know if they have been imprisoned
five times for embezzlement.&nbsp; It can also be viewed as a detrimental,
for example if you have a criminal record you may find no-one wants to
employ you.
<p>The data available to large organisations gives them a degree of control.&nbsp;
For instance, mortgage companies can run a credit check on you, and there
are many tales of people being rejected on the basis of a minor debt or
incorrect data.&nbsp; This can mean that unless someone conforms to the
very narrow specifications set out by large institutions, they will fall
outside of normal society.&nbsp; It is common practice for insurance agencies
to ask health related questions, such as whether a person smokes, how much
alcohol they drink, and so on.&nbsp; As information technology accelerates
this could be taken a step further, if retail sales are conducted electronically
every time someone buys cigarettes or alcohol it could be registered.&nbsp;
Similarly a swipe card could record how many times you go to a gym for
exercise.&nbsp; This data could then help an insurance broker adjust your
premium, or possibly invalidate your claim.&nbsp; All of this may sound
a bit far-fetched, and perhaps it is, but it is all possible from a technological
perspective.&nbsp; The important point is that as the amount of information
available about you increases, it will have an impact on your life.
<p>All of this information can be stored and processed because of the vast
amount of computer power available, and Moore's Law underpins all of this.
<p><b>A new computer again</b>
<p>Moore's Law also means constant change for the computer user.&nbsp;
The older the computer becomes, the more it struggles with newer applications.&nbsp;
(New games are often a good test of how up-to-date your computer is, since
they tend to make full use of the computer's power.)
<p>So do you carry on with it struggling, upgrade it, or do you buy a new
computer?&nbsp; If you use it a lot and like to use currently available
versions of software then carrying on with the existing machine probably
isn’t an option.&nbsp; However, many people use their computers mainly
for word processing or producing spreadsheets, and an older machine is
often perfectly adequate for these tasks.&nbsp; It is often said that most
people don't use a majority of the features in available applications anyway,
so upgrading to the new version of your word processor may not change the
work you produce in any significant manner.
<p>Looking at the options for upgrading your existing machine.&nbsp; It
is often the case that because of the rapid change in the computer industry,
buying upgrades for older machines is expensive. For instance, the RAM
chips in older computers can be more expensive than the ones compatible
with new machines.&nbsp; Upgrading can cost almost as much as buying a
new computer, and if you do go with selling the old machine, the original
price would have depreciated considerably, because of Moore's Law.
<p>This demonstrates the financial implications Moore's Law has on computer
buyers and manufacturers. Four months after a new computer is bought the
price has dropped.&nbsp; You could then, at this point, have a better machine
for the same money.
<p>Consider what the implications would be for another industry, like the
car industry, if it had an equivalent of Moore's Law.&nbsp; It would be
analogous to a new engine being developed every 18 months, and soon new
fuel being developed to take advantage of that engine. This new fuel would
still work with the previous engine, but not as well. If your engine was
more than three years old, it may not work at all with the new fuel.&nbsp;
You would soon have to buy a new car, with little return on your old one.
<p>This comparison should help you appreciate just how different the computing
industry is from any other.
