<p><b><u><font size=+2>Exercise 5 (Activity 4) : Summary</font></u></b></center>

<p><br>
<br>
<br>
<p><b>The group task:</b>
<br>Your group as a whole will produce a number of web pages, as follows:
<p><b>Page 1: T171 Group activity:</b> Developing web authoring skills
through collaborative work. This page should contain a brief description
of each student in the group followed by links to pages 2 to 4. Your group
should agree on a name and try and include some images, either to identify
the group or to add interest to the page.
<p><b>Page 2: Biographies of significant characters.</b> For this page
you should find some relevant links to biographies of the people listed
here. Write a short (i.e. sentence or two) summary of what their major
contribution was, and link to any good pages you find on them. The people
are: Bob Noyce, Paul Allen, Dan Bricklin, Bob Metcalfe and Don Estridge.
<p><b>Page 3: Development of the PC: timelines.</b> There are several timelines
available on the web which show the significant events in the development
of the PC. These often have a bias, depending on the source of the information.
For instance there is a timeline at the Intel web site, which naturally
focuses on the role of Intel microprocessors in the story. You should find
other timelines, and then produce a page which: EITHER Provides links to
the timelines, and states what events each timeline rates as significant,
if there are any discrepancies between the timelines you find. OR Summarises
them in your own timeline for Module 2. This is a good opportunity to practise
the clear-thinking principles, since you can examine the reasons any timeline
might have for promoting some events and perhaps ignoring others.
<p><b>Page 4: Different versions of events.</b> You should pick one significant
event from the story of the PC which you have covered so far and see if
you can find different versions of that event. The important thing here
is to realise that historical accounts give one version of events, and
you can often find ones which differ subtly. You should provide links to
the accounts of the event, and state how they differ, and if they differ,
from the one provided by Cringely. You can choose any event you wish, but
an interesting and often quoted one which might be fruitful is the story
of how Microsoft got the deal to provide DOS for the IBM PC.
<p>The pages should be uploaded to the web space of one of the group participants.&nbsp;
The group should check the pages to make sure they appear as intended and
are ready to be shown to other tutor groups! You should ensure that all
the participants are happy with the page, and that it contains appropriate
material.
<p><b>Your task:</b>
<br>You will contribute to the development of the first page and one of
the other pages. You should decide which of the pages 2-4 you would like
to work on. They will involve communication with other group members, and
some individual work. Your tutor will provide further details in your Tutor
Group conference, where all the discussions will take place, so watch that
space!

<p><b>(Additional) Notes from the Tutor:</b>
<p>This activity is about developing your web authoring skills and communicating
with other members of the group.
<p>In compiling these pages you should draw on and apply the following
resources: the ‘clear thinking’ section in the prep booklet and the ‘clear
writing’ resources in Module 2: planning, executing, and producing an explanation.
<p>We need 4 people participating in the tutor group, one for each page.
It is better if we have at least 2 people working together on each page.
The group page is the most important one, so you may decide that one or
more of the others can be left out.
<p><b>What do you need to do?</b>
<br>Place a note in the activity conference explaining your initial thoughts
on how the exercise could be tackled, and what role you would like to take
on.&nbsp; Also note any time constraint you may have. Review what the rest
of the group have suggested.&nbsp; Reply to comments to begin the process
of agreeing how to complete the activity. Decide as a group who is working
on which pages. Work on your contribution to the website.&nbsp; Post your
contribution for comments Incorporate any changes.&nbsp; Upload the final
pages to the web space you have chosen.
<p>Tip: Share the tasks in the group.
