<h2>
Module 3 reflection</h2>
I started this module with little knowledge about the internet despite
using it at work for email and intranet purposes.&nbsp; I have picked up
a lot from this module, learning about the early visions of Vannevar Bush
<a href="#Exercise 6">(Exercise
6)</a> and JCR Licklider, to the development and introduction of the Arpanet
by the D.O.D. in the 60s, its evolvment into the internet and of how the
world wide web came to be part of this
<a href="#the web">(6.3)</a>.&nbsp;
I obtained an understanding of the technology that makes it work, the protocols
involved, the thinking of the people behind it, exploring the evolving
culture on the net and how this has physically effected the internet itself
(such as Usenet or the Open Source movement).
<p>This module also allowed me to further develop skills introduced earlier,
searching the web <a href="#Exercise 2">(Exercise 2)</a> efficiently whilst
assessing findings reliably, using an online diary, coping with information
overload, and the creation of small web pages and sites.
<p>I will continue to explore the technology mentioned in this module,
as time and workload have not allowed me to investigate some aspects as
fully as I would have liked to, however I feel that I have met with the
objectives of the module, now having a clear understanding of exactly what
the internet is <a href="#History of the net">(1.4)</a>, how it came to
be, the technology that makes it work, the people and companies/organisations
that made it possible, and the culture of the net in todays world.
