# OU---FirstYearCourse---T171

This is the End of Course Assessment (ECA) for my first Open University course, ("T171: You, Your Computer, and The Internet").

My degree, BSc Hons IT & Computing, was completed part time over 10 years online through the Open University in the UK.
It frustratingly took so long because I was working fulltime with 5 children at the time, and I took a couple of years break in the middle due to finances.
Also, the honours degree was a year longer than the standard degree, but it was modular which helped a lot.
It was a real effort to see this degree through, but I pushed because I loved the subject matter and was committed to learning as much as I could.
I did not have a lot of support either, as most questioned what I was doing realising that I would not attain the degree until I was in my late 30s.

But, I went back to it after 2 year break and stuck with it. On hindsight they where probably right, 
I am 52 now (2022) and I have not been able to put my degree to use in my current job or use it to change in to the career I dream of having,
being a software developer.

Anyway, enough rambling, T171 was a hugely interesting level 1 course exploring the history of the internet, computers and computer science basics.
It opened my eyes to what the internet was (back in 2001 it was not widely used or even widely known about), introducing how the internet came to be, 
how it worked, what technologies it used.. routers, servers, protocols.. all that stuff. I also built my first basic webpage exploring html for the first
time. Wow! I loved this stuff, however looking at some of the projects I am doing now I dont feel I have moved on much for 20 years!.

This Project, the end of course assessment, was the final project for the course, explaining some of my journey and learnings. Having checked it now,
for the first time in 20 years, a lot of the links no longer work (to be expected I guess) but it still gives a good overview.

Hopefully you get some historical enjoyment from reviewing this.
