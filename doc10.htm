<center><b><font size=+2>The World Wide Web</font></b></center>

<p>The Internet is a world wide network of networks, the reason for its
existence, to accomodate the sharing of information and communication throughout
the globe.&nbsp; It plays host to a lot of different communication systems
and information sources, the biggest and most widely used being the <font color="#000000"><a href="http://cs.swau.edu/~thomas/CSIS105/Internic.guide/Internet.Basics/web/sld02.html">World
Wide Web</a></font>.&nbsp; The Web has been the main reason for the continuing
popularity and success of the Internet...
<p><b>...but where did it come from?</b>
<br>The Web was first conceived in 1989 by an englishman named <font color="#000000"><a href="http://www.ideafinder.com/history/inventors/berners-lee.htm">Tim
Berners-Lee</a></font>.&nbsp; He drew on the ideas of <font color="#000000"><a href="http://www.ruku.com/vannevar.html">Vannevar
Bush</a></font>, who in 1945 wrote an <a href="http://www.isg.sfu.ca/~duchier/misc/vbush/vbush0.shtml">article</a>
about a future mechanical device called a <font color="#000000"><a href="http://www.infonortics.com/searchengines/bath1997/ritchie/sld011.htm">Memex</a></font>,
which had many similarities to the Web of today.&nbsp; Berners-Lee fused
these ideas into a workable concept for a global, linked <font color="#000000"><a href="http://searchWebManagement.techtarget.com/sDefinition/0,,sid27_gci212301,00.html">hypertext</a></font>
system, also helping to write the software needed to implement it, and
devising the <font color="#000000"><a href="http://searchNetworking.techtarget.com/sDefinition/0,,sid7_gci212839,00.html">protocols</a></font>
needed to make it a reality.

Berners lee's original proposal for the web</a> <b>&lt;&lt;</b></font></center>

<p>The Web software and protocols were first released in 1991, but it didn't
really take off until 1993, when Mosaic, a web browser with a <font color="#000000"><a href="doc9.htm">Graphical
User Interface</a></font>, was released.&nbsp; Mosaic vastly improved the
usability of the Web, apart from a more contemporary 'look and feel', it
allowed graphics and text on the same page for the first time, while also
making browser software available to the personal computer.&nbsp; This
led to a 'browser boom', and a huge increase in internet usage, often referred
to as the '<i>explosion of the web</i>'.
<p><b>The technology behind it</b>
<br>The World Wide Web operates on what is known as Client/Server architecture
(see below), using web protocols which govern how information is compiled,
sent and received over it.&nbsp; All documents or files on the Web are
written in <font color="#000000"><a href="http://lcweb.loc.gov/loc/guides/html.html">HTML</a>
format</font>, held on <font color="#000000"><a href="http://www.sidenet.com/faq.html#webserve">Servers</a></font>
connected to the Internet, and are allocated a unique address known as
the <font color="#000000"><a href="http://www.norcol.ac.uk/create/guides/studyguide/html/whaturl.html">URL</a>.</font>&nbsp;
To view these documents you use a <font color="#000000"><a href="http://www.norcol.ac.uk/create/guides/studyguide/html/whatisabrowser.html">Browser</a></font>
(a 'client' program, such as <font color="#000000"><a href="http://www.wunderland.com/WTS/Jake/CubeArt/Descriptions/MosaicHistory.html">Mosaic</a></font>
or <font color="#000000"><a href="http://www.phdsystems.com/tutorials/internet/netscape/sld01.html">Navigator</a></font>),
which retrieves a document from the Server using a protocol such as <font color="#009900"><a href="http://searchSystemsManagement.techtarget.com/sDefinition/0,,sid20_gci214004,00.html">HTTP</a></font>
or <a href="http://kb.indiana.edu/data/aerg.html">FTP</a>, and displays
it on your screen.

<p><b>The explosion of the Web</b>
<br>Due to its versatility, the web is used for a vast number of purposes,
communication, shopping, advertising, entertainment, researching, teaching,
filing, and customer support, to mention but a few.&nbsp; The working world
and even people at home are now seeing the advantages in having a 'net
presence', it is a cheap and effective means of information distribution,
and an extremely quick and cost-effective means of communication.
<p>There are several ways of measuring this phenomena, mainly by the number
of users, connected computers, domains/hosts, websites, and internet traffic.&nbsp;

<li>
Tim Berners-Lee founded the <a href="http://www.w3.org/Overview.html">World
Wide Web Consortium</a> (W3C, sometimes referred to as W3O) in 1994, in
order to lead the Web to its full potential. It is a standards body which
will also stablise the development of the protocols: url, html and http
etc.</li>
