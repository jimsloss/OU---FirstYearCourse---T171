Module 1 reflection</h2>
In learning by doing <a href="mod1.html">this module</a> was effective
in its teaching and preparation for future modules.
<p>Aside from the open learning style, from the preparation material I
picked up some new skills, such as finding/moving files and creating shortcuts,
moving on to learning the fundamentals of e-mail (<a href="#email">Exercise
1</a>)and reviewing the main applications, word processing, spreadsheets,
databases and graphics software.&nbsp; The skill of 'learning to learn'
was the approach taken to learning about applications and has already proven
useful.&nbsp; I also developed my personal communication skills, most specifically
learning to work with others online, working as part of an online group
in order to complete several activities.&nbsp; Some group activities involved
creating individual and group web pages, a skill I had picked up earlier
(<a href="#web page">Exercise 25</a>) in the module.
<p>One of the most important aspects of this module was in becoming an
effective learner.&nbsp; I am new to higher level education and picking
up basic learning skills such as organising time and study space, clear
thinking, note-taking (<a href="#Notes">Section 2.1</a>), summarising documents
etc have already proved invaluable in completing this course.
<p>From this learning I have met with the objectives of the module, having
learnt more about the practical skills of using computers, and 'learning
to learn' new applications.&nbsp; I can now communicate and work effectively
as part of an online group, while also having obtained learning skills
which will help with future study. This Module gave me great confidence
in using my computer.
