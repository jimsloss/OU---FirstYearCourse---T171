<b><u><font size=+1>Welcome to Module 1 - Computing
with confidence</font></u></b>
<p>At the start section 1 there was a short audio-visual presentation by
Gary Alexander, the author of this module.&nbsp; The text below is a transcript
of the audio track from the presentation.
<p>“&nbsp; Hello and welcome. I’m Gary Alexander, the author of Module
1, and I want to specially welcome those of you who are new to computing
or those who haven’t done any formal learning for a long time.
<p>&nbsp;We’ve improved this module based upon the experience of students
in last year’s pilot presentation. And I hope you will find that you learn
a lot, and at the same time enjoy yourselves and meet some interesting
people.
<p><b>Learning by doing</b>
<br>You will find that the approach of this module is very practical. You
will be learning by doing.
<p>There are a lot of small tasks for you to practise on, so that you can
build your skills gradually. As you complete these tasks you will be building
a collection of completed work which you can show to others.
<p><b>Learning by working with others</b>
<br>A feature of the ‘supported open learning’ in this course is that you
will be learning by working with others.
<p>You will join an online community where you will meet other students
and Open University staff. Through computer communications you will be
able to get help and give help, and even join in various online social
activities.
<p><b>Learn when it suits you</b>
<br>This style of open learning means that you can work at times that suit
your schedule. You don’t have to be at classes at any special times and
can work from the privacy of your home and workplace.
<p>However, you will have to keep up with the pace of the course, especially
when you are working with others in a group.
<p><b>Aims of the module - 2 levels</b>
<br>To help you to understand the overall approach of Module 1, I have
separated its aims into two levels:.
<p>a training level, in which it aims to teach the practical skills of
using computers; and
<br>a university academic level, which aims to teach learning skills suitable
for those&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; beginning
serious learning.
<p>You will find that these learning skills are valuable in a changing
world, even if you don’t continue with formal study.
<p><b>Basic computer skills</b>
<br>The training level starts with the most basic computer skills:
<p>moving and resizing windows;
<br>finding files and applications on your hard disk, opening and closing
them, organising&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; them into
files and directories.
<p>All of this is covered in the Working with Windows booklets in the preparatory
material. By now, when you are about to start the main part of Module 1,
you should already have done this. If not you might find the module much
harder than you would like.
<p><b>Becoming fluent with your computer</b>
<br>As you work through the module you will be taught the most common uses
of computers:
<p>E-mail and the World Wide Web; and
<br>the main office software: word processors, spreadsheets, databases
and graphics software.
<p><b>Becoming an effective learner</b>
<br>The university level aims of the module are partly about becoming an
effective learner.
<p>The most basic learning skills - organising your time and study space,
and an introduction to clear thinking - are in the preparatory material,
which you should have looked at already.
<p>As the module progresses you will gain experience with note taking and
summarising documents and writing short essays.
<p>One particular skill is that of ‘learning to learn’, so that you can
learn effectively on your own, without training courses. This is the approach
we will take for learning about computers.
<p><b>Personal communication skills</b>
<br>The most important of the university-level aims of the module are for
you to develop your personal communication skills, and especially, skills
of working in a group online.
<p>One of the most important uses of the Internet today is to enable groups
who are geographically dispersed to work as a team. You will need to develop
skills of teamwork, how to know you have been understood, and skills of
presenting your ideas using a computer.
<p><b>Module structure</b>
<br>Now for a more detailed look at the module. It lasts for 10 weeks and
is divided into four sections:
<p>Learning in cyberspace - 2 weeks
<br>Group learning in cyberspace - 3 weeks
<br>Computing with confidence - 2 weeks
<br>Web skills - 3 weeks
<p>You should expect to put in something like 6 hours per week as a minimum.
If you are a beginner it may be a lot longer, and will depend upon how
thorough you wish to be.
<p><b>Section 1 - Learning in cyberspace</b>
<br>The module gets off to a gentle start with the basics of e-mail and
computer conferencing to enable you to contact other students and staff
and begin to get help if you need it. There will be an icebreaker activity
in your tutor group to help you to get to know each other.
<p><b>Section 2 - Group learning in cyberspace</b>
<br>The second section gives you a chance to consolidate your online computing
skills while developing your skills of online groupwork. The study skills
are taking notes and summarising documents.
<p>There will be a group exercise in which you try to come to a consensus
on the most important points in a set of documents on groupwork. This will
be used in your first assessment of the course.
<p><b>Section 3 - Computing with confidence</b>
<br>The third section is an intensive look at more software. Thus you will:
<p>deepen your knowledge of word processors;
<br>learn a bit about graphics software;
<br>learn the basics of spreadsheets; and
<br>get a taste of using databases.
<p>The emphasis is on how to learn about software yourself, not on getting
a comprehensive knowledge of any particular package. The number of different
packages you cover will depend upon how fast you are able to go. You don’t
need to learn all of them.
<p><b>Section 4 - Web skills</b>
<br>The final section forms the climax to the module. You will learn about
the World Wide Web: first how to find information on it and then how to
create and publish your own Web documents.
<p>The main activity will be a group project in which you and your group
will create a Web channel. Each of you will be searching the Web on some
topic of interest to you. You will then produce a web page on the results
which will form part of the joint Web channel. Your part in this will form
part&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
of the assessment for the module.
<p><b>At the end of Module 1 ...</b>
<br>By the end of the 10 weeks, with a reasonable amount of effort, and
a little help from your new friends online, you should feel comfortable
with your computer skills and with your learning skills and be ready to
go on to the later modules.”
