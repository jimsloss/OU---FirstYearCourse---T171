<h2>
Group working</h2>
This course has been my first attempt at working within a group on-line
and I have come to few conclusions regarding my experience.
<p><b>Group working on-line certainly proved to have its advantages;</b>
<ul>
<li>
The discomfort or biased views that might normally present themselves in
group meetings on race, colour, religion or gender are absent.</li>

<li>
Each person can contribute whenever their own schedule allowed it and from
wherever was most suitable to them.</li>

<li>
Group members tend to discuss problems they have come across and how they
were resolved.</li>

<li>
The 'project' is an ongoing discussion, with continuing contribution.</li>

<li>
Group activity on-line can be more productive, ideas can be discussed more
openly and investigated more thoroughly.</li>

<li>
There is more time to think and review participation before contributing.</li>

<li>
Feedback is more creative.</li>

<li>
There is a reviewable record of the discussion to date.</li>
</ul>
<b>Some dis-advantages also emerged;</b>
<ul>
<li>
There can be cluttered, unclear or irrelevant messages.</li>

<li>
Some group members can be unwilling or unable to partake due to lack of
ability.</li>

<li>
Meeting deadlines or keeping to agreed timetables can be harder, as all
members work at their own speed.</li>

<li>
Body-language is missing, therefore its easier to take things out-of-context
or mis-interpret them. There is need for greater care in what you are saying,
and how you say it.</li>
</ul>

<p><br>In <a href="act3-sum.html">Activity 3</a> each group member created
their own web page, linking it to a <a href="http://oufcnt5.open.ac.uk/~jim_sloss/homepage.htm">main
'group' web channel</a>*.&nbsp; Here are some examples from this, illustrating
some of the points above.

<p><font color="#006600">Could I make a suggestion for stage 2. If we have
our links to our individual pages ready before 10 April we could let each
other know,&nbsp; it could help us in deciding a style for stage 3.</font>
<p><font color="#006600">I also have a question .&nbsp; I take it we will
have our individual pages saved on a server like our First class server,&nbsp;
but do I have to use AOL Press or could I use Frontpage?</font>
