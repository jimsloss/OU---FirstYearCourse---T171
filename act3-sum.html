<p>Hello everybody!
<p>Here are some details for our third tutor group activity.
<br>Note: You will need to do this work in order to complete the second
assignment.
<p><b>What is this activity about?</b>
<p>The main aim of the activity is to work together to create a group web
channel.
<p>You will also experience what it is like to produce work collaboratively
in an online environment, and collect work towards TMA02.
<p>For this purpose: the whole tutor group will be working together (I
have created a sub-conference for this activity called T171 pc836 Activity
3 ).
<p>As there are 7 topic areas, I suggest that each of them is worked on
by two of you. Of course the two individuals concerned will need to choose
a different aspect of the topic, in order to avoid duplication.
<p><b>What do you need to do?</b>
<p>Check out the TMA requirements! Have a look at the requirements in the
TMA02 assignment.
<p>You will see that each of you needs to choose a subject that you will
investigate for your own page. So the first thing you have to do is agree
which subject each of you is doing.
<p>Individually you will gather information, then create you own individual
web page which provides links to sites on your subject. As a group, you
will then need to create a group web-page with a list of contents and links
to each member's individual page - thus forming the group’s web channel.
<p>For the assignment you will also need to reflect on the experience of
working together.
<p>Find your working area. If you can’t find T171 pc836 Activity 3 let
me know quickly. If you are using Personal off-line reader you will need
to log in to find your group’s sub-conference.
<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp; Start the groupwork by discussing and agreeing your subject
with your fellow students, and deciding how you will work together to produce
what is needed by the set date. For instance, do you need some sort of
timetable to follow, and if so, how will you set the dates? What sort of
style will you use? How will the group page be put together? Will you look
out for information that could help other members of your group? Use what
you have learnt from Working in cyberspace to do this.
<p>Create a plan to help you complete the whole assignment on time.
<p>Tips:
<br>Read the TMA notes thoroughly before you prepare to take part in the
activity, so that you know what you need to do. For example, the TMA asks
you to include copies of up to 3 messages that you sent to your group concerning
the web channel.
<p>Keep notes on how things progress, so that you can complete the reflection
needed in TMA02.
<p>Look at the list of subjects to see what you would find interesting
to work on, but be prepared with more than one choice, so you can accommodate
others in the group.
<p>Ask other members of the group for ideas and feedback, and take an active
part in the discussion from now on.
<p>As usual, just email me if you have any query.
<p>Paolo
