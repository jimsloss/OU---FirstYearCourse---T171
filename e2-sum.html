<p><b><u><font size=+1>Summary of Exercise 2: Understanding search engines</font></u></b></center>

<p>Anyone can search the Net by typing a query into a search engine, but
that doesn't mean they can find what they are looking for. In order to
become an effective and efficient online researcher, you will need to acquire
some factual and craft knowledge.
<p>I have provided a Learning Resource which contains lots of information
about search engines and search techniques. It's there for you to draw
on as you work through the exercises below. I also provide links to online
courses on searching the Net which have been created by external institutions.
<p><b>Activity 1: Comparing different types of search engines</b>
<p>Go to AltaVista and search for information on "History of the Internet".
<p>Do the same for Yahoo!
<p>Make some notes about the results produced by both search engines.
<p>What do you think accounts for the different results?
<p>Hint: See the page Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) about search engines
from the Knowledge, Skill and Cunning Learning Resource.
<p><b>Activity 2: Locating specific items using AltaVista</b>
<p>Use AltaVista to search for profiles of Bill Gates, the co-founder and
Chief Executive of Microsoft.
<p>Hint: Given Gates's promimence, there are hundreds of thousands of pages
about him on the Web. You will therefore have to narrow your search to
pages containing profiles of Gates. I suggest you read the web page How
to narrow a search from the Knowledge, Skill and Cunning resource.
<p><b>Activity 3: Locate a photograph of Gates</b>
<p>Hint: Images on the Web tend to have the suffix .gif or .jpg. So a photograph
of Gates might be tagged as "bgates.gif". AltaVista allows you to search
for images by using the syntax
<p>image: &lt;filename>
<p>When you have located a photograph of Gates, save it to your hard disk
and paste the photograph in your Study Guide template. See the Learning
Resource page on capturing images from the web if you are unsure about
how to do this.
<p>Remember that in general items found on the web are subject to copyright
restrictions. However, you are free to copy an image if you are not subsequently
putting it on public show, or if you are including it in an assignment
for assessment.
