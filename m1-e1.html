<p><b><u><font size=+2>Exercise 1: E-mail</font></u></b></center>

<p>In this exercise I made my first connection of the course to other people
online.
<p>I learnt to read and send e-mail via the FirstClass browser, also how
to reply to a message received, to forward a message, and to check the
'history' of a message.
<p>The details are specific to the Open University's system, which uses
e-mail and conferencing software called 'FirstClass'. However, many of
the operations are common to most or all e-mail and conference systems.
<p>The FirstClass link opens a new window in the browser.
<p>I Connected to the OU's Electronic Campus by clicking on the FirstClass
button in the navigation panel on the site window.&nbsp; This took me to
a login prompt for FirstClass. I entered my OU computer Username and FirstClass
password, my FirstClass desktop then appeared.
<p>(The letter from the OU gave my computer username, password and which
server my e-mail account has been allocated to, Server 5. You can find
out which server you are on by checking your personal menu at http://www.open.ac.uk/students).
<p>At the top of your FirstClass 'desktop' is the toolbar (the icons),
and under each icon is a label that describes its function.
<p>Tip: One of the first steps you should always take when learning new
software is to systematically check out the controls, especially the toolbars.
<p>There is an array of icons in the centre of the FirstClass desktop window.
The top left one is your personal mailbox, the others are conferences to
which you have access. You can open a message in your mailbox by clicking
on the underlined subject line.
<p>I practiced sending e-mail messages using the set of 'virtual students'
to correspond with, these were known as 'the fruities' (due to their names).
<p>To send a message click on the New button on the toolbar, which gives
a new message form, with your name in the 'from' position, in the subject
box, type your message and in the To: box fill in the name of the e-mail
address of the person your sending your message to.&nbsp; Click on the
Send button at the bottom of the form to send your message, this should
give you a message confirming the message has been sent successfully.
<p>If a message in your in-box has ‘Re’ in front of the subject then it
indicates a reply. Sets of messages which are replies to other messages,
or replies to replies, etc. all on the same subject, are called a 'thread'
of messages.&nbsp; Notice that you don't have to type in the 'Re', it is
put in automatically by FirstClass, and the message becomes part of a thread.
If you type ''Re" in your subject line, FirstClass will not know that the
message is part of a thread. Also, you will find that there is a copy of
the reply in the lower part of the window, with each line preceded by the
'>' symbol. This convention is equivalent to quotation marks.&nbsp; You
can edit this text if need be.
<p>If you want to send a copy of a message you have received to someone
else (or to a conference), with the message still open, click on the Forward
message button on the toolbar. You will see a new message form with the
From: and Subject: fields filled in, but with the To: field blank, for
you to fill in as needed.&nbsp; Then click on Send.
<p>To check on the history of a message, click on the History button in
the toolbar, whilst in the message. You will see when it was created, sent
and all the people who have read it.
