<p><b>Message sent to group conference from tutor introducing activity
2.</b>
<br>
<hr WIDTH="100%">
<p><font size=-1>Hello everybody!</font>
<p><font size=-1>I hope you are all progressing nicely with the course.</font>
<br><font size=-1>This message contains the information needed to start
the second tutor group activity. This may help you complete the first assignment.</font>
<p><font size=-1>What is this activity about?</font>
<p><font size=-1>The aim of the activity is to:</font>
<p><font size=-1>a) explore the principles behind netiquette and effective
group working.</font>
<br><font size=-1>b) have a go at using the tutor group conference to reach
a shared understanding within the group</font>
<p><font size=-1>The final outcome of this activity will be a list of ‘rules’
that we as a group can use to help make our collective work more effective
and efficient over the rest of the year.</font>
<p><font size=-1>What do you need to do?</font>
<p><font size=-1>1. Review the material in Module 1, Section 2: Group working
in cyberspace. This section lists articles that discuss issues about netiquette
and group working.</font>
<p><font size=-1>2. From (at least one of) these articles note 1 or 2 ideas
that you think our group could adopt to help us work together for the rest
of the year.</font>
<p><font size=-1>3. Share your ideas with the rest of the group by posting
a message about your ideas in this conference</font>
<p><font size=-1>4. Review what the rest of the group have suggested. Reply
to comments where you agree or think an idea could be developed further.</font>
<p><font size=-1>5. Finally, review the whole group discussion and post
a further message about any extra idea you have thought of as a result
of the discussion.</font>
<p><font size=-1>When will the activity start and finish?</font>
<p><font size=-1>The activity starts from today and will end on the 6th
March. This is 10 days before the assignment is due to give you time to
finalise your work.</font>
<p><font size=-1>How will the list of principles for the group be drawn
together?</font>
<p><font size=-1>I will summarise the discussion and create a list after
the 6th of March. You will all need to check my list in case I miss anything.
We can then review and develop this list as the year progresses.</font>
<p><font size=-1>A few tips:</font>
<p><font size=-1>Read the TMA before you prepare to take part in the activity,
so that you know what you need to do. You may not need to read all the
articles. Choose two that interest you. Then devise your first note for
the conference. Once you have read other peoples ideas, you may want to
read the other articles.</font>
<p><font size=-1>Email me if you feel that you need more clarification
on any points.</font>
<p><font size=-1>I will give some more information in the following days.</font>
<p><font size=-1>Cheers,</font>
<p><font size=-1>Paolo</font>
