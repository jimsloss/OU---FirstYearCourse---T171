Module 2 reflection</h2>
Module 2 was very informative, there was a lot of reading and information
to absorb.
<p>Knowing little about the history of the PC it was interesting to read
about companies such as Microsoft, Apple and IBM who founded the industry,
the people involved, Gates &amp; Allen, Gary Kildall, Wozniak &amp; Jobs,
Bob Taylor, for example and the technology behind it, such as the microprocessor
from Intel and various technologies from Xerox Parc.&nbsp; It was also
interesting to read the development from this point and how <a href="#Moores law">Moores
law</a> has underpinned this, continuing to do so.
<p>In completing this module I have also learnt some practical aspects
of computing, the basic architecture of a computer, the functions of hardware
and software components, operating systems, binary bits and bytes, what
effects computer power, the different types of computers and how they work,
command-line and graphical user interfaces and the difference between analogue
and digital.
<p>Other practical tasks learnt which have helped with studying are note
taking, <a href="#E3">reading skills</a>, keeping an online study journal,
and <a href="#E5">developing my web authoring skills</a> further.
<p>I can now give an informed account of the development of the pc, identifying
the key people, organisations and technologies that played a part, now
having the ability to explain the basic architecture of a computer and
the functions of hardware &amp; software, while understanding business
concepts relevant to the PC industry. As such I have met with the objectives
of the Module.
