<p><b><u><font size=+2>Reading and taking notes</font></u></b></center>

<p>At various points in the course, you will be asked to read documents,
take notes and make summaries of them. To be able to do so effectively
is a skill, to be learnt like any other.
<p>The key resource for this activity is Chapter 2 of the book, The Sciences
Good Study Guide, by Northedge, Thomas, Lane and Peasgood. If it appeals
to you, you may wish to buy the book. It is available in, or can be ordered
from, most book shops.
<p>The chapter is presented in a form which looks exactly like the printed
book.
<p>One major advantage of presenting the chapter in this form is that you
don't have to be online to read it. Be sure to disconnect once it has been
downloaded. You then have the choice of reading it on your screen or printing
it out and reading it on paper.
<p>If you read it on your screen you will have to learn the basics of Acrobat
Reader, which is not difficult. The main point is to adjust the size of
the image so that it is comfortable for you to read. I find it is easiest
if I select the Acrobat's View menu and set it to 'Fit width', 'Continuous'
and 'Thumbnails and Page'. Then all you have to do is scroll to read the
whole chapter.
<p>Read <u><font color="#3333FF">The Sciences Good Study Guide, Chapter
2 - Reading and making notes</font></u><font color="#000000"> (link not
operational, but when you clicked on this it downloaded to your hard disk,
and opened automatically using 'Acrobat Reader'.)</font>. You will also
need the 'Collee paper', which is used as an example for note taking.
<p>This chapter was written assuming you would be using paper for your
notes, but principles in it apply to all forms of note taking. You may
choose to make your notes on paper, or alternatively, you could make them
in your word processor and save them in your 'Module 1 notes' document.
