<center><b><font size=+1>The Graphical User Interface</font></b></center>

<p><b>Introduction</b>
<p>Computers are now a part of everyday life, not only have they become
part of the modern working environment but they have also become a necessary
piece of home-use equipment or leisure item for most.
<p>Much of the success of the PC lies in its useability.&nbsp; In the past
using a computer meant using a <a href="http://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/0,,sid9_gci213627,00.html">command-line</a>
interface, the computer relying on what you typed in order to perform even
the simplest task.&nbsp; In order to use the computer efficiently you had
to be fluent in the computer's language.&nbsp; There has been no change
in the underlying reliance of computers on the use of computer language
to perform tasks, the difference is that most computers now have a <a href="http://kb.indiana.edu/data/afhv.html">graphical
user interface</a>, with advantages such as icons, mouse interaction, toolbars,
menus, help screens and windows, making computers much more user friendly.
<p><b>The History</b>

<br><b>The Alto</b></center>

<p>The first computer to use a graphical interface was the
<a href="http://www.newmedianews.com/tech_hist/alto.html">Alto</a>,
built at <a href="http://www.parc.xerox.com/history.html">Xerox Parc</a>
in 1973, but they decided not to market it. Following a visit to Parc by
<a href="http://www.ideafinder.com/history/inventors/jobs.htm">Steve
Jobs</a> in 1979, the first commercial use of the technology (which included
the 'desktop' metaphor) came when
<a href="http://www.apple.com/">Apple</a>
released
<a href="http://www.lowendmac.com/lisa/lisa.shtml">the Lisa</a>.&nbsp;
But the Lisa was expensive, so the GUI did not become a viable option for
the PC until <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/">Microsoft</a> introduced
its <a href="http://pla-netx.com/linebackn/guis/">Windows</a> operating
system.&nbsp; By introducing Windows Microsoft brought an affordable and
extremely usable system to the general public, which became the standard
and made the GUI standard throughout the industry.

<p><b>The GUI problem</b>
<p>Command-line interfaces often allow greater flexibility and control,
they're fast and close to the computer, using few resources, however they
can be extremly cryptic and take some time to learn.&nbsp; The graphical
interface takes up more of your computer's resources, making it slower
and more problematic, it is also heavily dependant on mouse usage and graphical
images, and is therefore not user-friendly for the physically impaired,
(although <a href="http://www.the-fbc.org/techcenter/sales/screenreader.html">screen-reading
technology</a> addresses part of the problem).&nbsp; The GUI also keeps
users away from what is really happening 'underneath the hood'.
<p><b>The dominance of Windows</b>
<br>Microsoft's Windows operating system has become the dominant standard,
mainly due to shrewd marketing and cost rather than physical quality or
efficiency.&nbsp; As a result this has bred contempt and <font color="#009900"><a href="http://i-want-a-website.com/about-microsoft/amsn.html">anti-microsoft</a></font>
users, who will not use windows (or any microsoft product) as a matter
of principle.
<p><b>Conclusion</b>
<br>By increasing useability the graphical interface made the computer
available to a much wider range of people, encouraging creativity, connectivity
and a new way of working.&nbsp; It undoubtedly effected the popularity
and success of the pc, however computers have <font color="#000000">come
on in other ways to</font>, (such as networking and microprocessor developments),
therefore the GUI is not the only reason for its success.&nbsp; There's
an ongoing <a href="http://www.webbuildermag.com/upload/free/features/webbuilder/1999/Udell/1998-12-08.asp">usability
debate</a>, and from this it would seem that most users would prefer advancements
in synergy between CLI and GUI, in order to promote usability and enhance
capability.
