<p><b><u><font size=+1>Summary of Assignment 02 (TMA02)</font></u></b></center>

<p><b><i>Part 1- Creating an individual page for a group web</i></b>
<p>This assignment will be linked to the work that you do as a group in
the Tutor Group Activity: '<a href="act3-sum.html">Creating a web channel</a>'.
<p>You should produce an individual web page covering a particular subject
from those listed below which contains, as a minimum:
<ul>
<li>
A set of links to 5 web sites relevant to your subject.</li>

<li>
For each link, a paragraph or two reviewing that site so that the audience
will know what to expect if they go to it. (You should apply the 'clear
thinking' principles of including the perspective of the sources, indicating
the context in which ideas apply and separating observations from theories.)</li>

<li>
Marks will be given for the general presentation and technical aspects
of your individual page (eg: links should work).</li>
</ul>
<b>The subject areas</b>
<br>Your page should be in one of the subject areas given below. Within
the broad subject area you should choose some issue or question on which
to focus and then try to find links to pages which answer that question
or illuminate that issue. You are free to choose this focus to suit your
own interests.
<ul>
<li>
<b><i>Health and disease</i></b></li>

<li>
<b><i>Current affairs</i></b></li>

<li>
<b><i>Environment</i></b></li>

<li>
<b><i>Science and technology</i></b></li>

<li>
<b><i>Music</i></b></li>

<li>
<b><i>Arts and culture</i></b></li>

<li>
<b><i>Sport</i></b></li>
</ul>
(some ideas where given on possible topics within these subject areas)
<p><b>Templates</b>
<br>Templates where provided for enhancement.
<p><b>Copyright issues</b>
<br>Guidelines were given on copyright issues, the main points were:
<ul>
<li>
In general, you cannot incorporate material from other sources in your
own work without first receiving permission from the copyright holder.</li>

<li>
As a student you may use copyright material for your own personal study
purposes only. If you later want to use the same material for any other
purpose, you must seek permission.</li>

<li>
Wherever you include a picture from another site, you should include a
caption acknowledging the source (the URL) and date accessed.</li>

<li>
If you quote directly from another site, another student or any other source,
you must use quotation marks and acknowledge the source (for a web site,
also include the date accessed).</li>
</ul>

<p><br><b><i>Part 2 - Reflecting on Module 1</i></b>
<p>In part 2 of this assignment your task is to produce a word processor
document in which you reflect on what you have learned about:
<ul>
<li>
Computing with confidence in Sections 3 and 4</li>

<li>
The groupwork involved in creating your web channel in part 1 of this TMA.</li>
</ul>
Part 2(a) should be no more than 500 words, and in part 2(b) items (i)-(v)
should be no more than 400 words in total.
<p><b>(a) Computing with confidence</b>
<p>Imagine that you are writing to a friend, or a colleague, who is just
beginning to use computers and computer communications. This friend has
asked you for advice on key aspects of computing with confidence. In particular,
your friend has asked if you could do the following:
<p>(i) Explain your own experiences in learning to use your computer and
one or more of the new software packages you learned in Sections 3 or 4.
If none of these were new to you, explain how you developed your existing
skills further. Give specific examples of what was easy or difficult to
learn, where you got stuck and how you overcame this. Illustrate your explanation
with samples of working from the specific package.
<p>(ii) Explain the key principles or techniques you have found which help
in learning about computers. This should demonstrate your 'learning to
learn' skills. It should explain how, other than being shown specific commands
and key-presses, you can increase your computing abilities.
<p><b>(b) The groupwork in your web channel.</b>
<p>This assignment requires you to reflect and comment on the group work
that you carried out in the Tutor Group Activity: 'Creating a web channel',
to show you have understood some of the issues involved in working in a
group.
<p>Your group web channel you created was an opportunity to apply what
you learned about groupwork online in Section 2. It may or may not have
been particularly successful. Write a paragraph on each of the following:
<p>(i) Describe the way your group worked in producing its web channel.
<p>(ii) Describe ways in which the principles you learned in the readings
in Section 2 either were applied or were not.
<p>(iii) Did the group help individuals to produce better work than they
could have individually?
<p>(iv) Were there any conflicts or problems in reaching consensus, and
if so, how were they resolved?
<p>(v) Did all the members of the group put in sufficient effort, and if
not, how was this handled?
<p>(vi) Illustrate the effectiveness (or lack of it) of the groupwork with
evidence from your conference. Include copies of 3 messages that you sent
to your group concerning the web channel.
<p><b>Submitting the assignment</b>
<br>The OU's electronic TMA system only allows you to submit a single file
for your TMA, but you will have several. There is a way of combining several
files into one, and at the same time compressing them all so they take
up much less space. This is called 'zipping', and there are many programs
available which zip and unzip files. There is a copy of a zip program called
Info-ZIP WiZ included with this course, which should have been put on your
hard disk when you installed the course software from the On-Line Applications
CD-ROM.
