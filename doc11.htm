Discussion on docs 9 and 10</h1>

<p><br><b>The GUI effect</b>
<br>The <a href="doc9.htm">Graphical User Interface</a> was a key element
in the success of the PC and the Web.&nbsp; Before the GUI the PC and the
Internet were both realms for the computer literate, needing specialised
knowledge in order to accomplish anything worthwhile from them.&nbsp; The
GUI brought usabilty and familiarity to these areas, opening the door for
a new world of users.
<p><b>The Web effect</b>
<br>Before <a href="doc10.htm">the Web</a> the Internet was far from user-friendly,
usage was limited mainly to computer experts, engineers, scientists, and
librarians.&nbsp; The web allowed the average person to access and use
the Internet, without the need for specialist knowledge or terminals.&nbsp;
Its hypertext nature and sheer volume of information makes the Web a highly
usable and useful tool, <font color="#000000">so much can </font><font color="#009900"><a href="http://www.global.net.uk/home/tour/tour3.asp">now
be achieved</a></font><font color="#000000"> from a simple home-computer</font>
that they are fast becoming a necessary household appliance.&nbsp; There
is also <font color="#000000">much to gain</font> for any business having
a <a href="http://www.webprose.net/what_benefit.html">net-presence</a>.
<p><b>Similarities &amp; Differences</b>
<p>Using a PC with a graphical interface has many similarities to using
the Web;
<ul>
<li>
Whichever computer or application you use, or if sending/receiving email,
visiting sites on the net, or compiling a web page, all of these have a
familiar setting.&nbsp; Those menus, toolbars, icons, and helpscreens are
always there, a benefit from <a href="http://searchNetworking.techtarget.com/sDefinition/0,,sid7_gci212839,00.html">protocols</a>
and standards.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
When you search for a file on your hard disc you specify a path to it,
in the same way that the <a href="http://www.norcol.ac.uk/create/guides/studyguide/html/whaturl.html">URL</a>
locates a web page, however the URL normally provides that path for you,
whereas with your pc you have to negotiate the route yourself, via a series
of selections with a mouse.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
You can find a file on your hard drive by using the search facilities provided,
<a href="http://www.accd.edu/pac/lrc/searchww.htm">search
engines</a> provide this facility for the web.&nbsp; Your PC can find a
specific file in seconds, however locating a file on the net can prove
much more time consuming.&nbsp; To narrow your findings you need to be
proficient in using the webs search facilities.</li>
</ul>
It is a common mistake to see the Web as a graphical interface to the Internet,
it is not.&nbsp; The Internet plays host to the Web, allowing it to function
via its network of networked computers, however the Web itself is a system
of protocols and <a href="http://searchWebManagement.techtarget.com/sDefinition/0,,sid27_gci212301,00.html">hypertext
links</a>, a means of working, shopping, communicating, advertising, researching,
and even entertainment, which can be accessed via any interface to the
Internet.
<p><b>Assessing possible future developments</b>
<p>Computing and networking has come a long way, with major changes having
taken place enroute, it would therefore not seem inappropriate to think
that major changes are ahead as well.

<li>
The <a href="http://www.sciam.com/2000/0600issue/0600reed.html#link5">Molecular
Electronics Circuit</a> and similar advancements could led to integrated
web access via everyday objects.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
The Internet is likely to be <a href="http://www.w3.org/TV/">linked to
television</a>, which should have considerable effect on the PC.</li>

<a href="http://www.scientificamerican.com/2001/0501issue/0501berners-lee.html">The
Semantic Web</a> would provide a new form of Web content that is meaningful
to computers, proving these views correct in part: <a href="http://www.systemlogic.net/articles/00/10/future/">Future
